## I'll add solutions as a work through the book. If you want to contribute just hit me with a PR

Note that the code will probably look ugly from time to time and I might skip some exercise in some chapters and come back to them later.


* Chapter 1 mostly done
* Chapter 2 has some error and incomplete solutions
* Chapter 3 has several missing excersies and some incomplete solutions
